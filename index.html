    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>

    <h2><a href="./aboutme.html">About Me</a></h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Maeen — a passionate software engineering student at Bahçeşehir University with a strong interest in artificial intelligence and data science. Originally from Libya, I bring a global perspective and a deep curiosity for technology’s potential to solve real-world problems.

        I enjoy building things with code, learning new tools and languages, and constantly improving my skills. I’m currently expanding my knowledge through Udemy courses and working toward gaining real-world experience through internships. My goal is to become a skilled software engineer and work with leading tech companies like Google or Microsoft.
        
        Beyond coding, I love reading, exploring new cultures, and dreaming about future travels — especially to places like Japan and Italy.
        
        Let’s build the future together.
    </p>
